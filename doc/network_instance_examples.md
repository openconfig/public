# OpenConfig Interfaces, Network Instance and VLANs

**Contributors:** Rob Shakir & OpenConfig WG members

There have been a number of questions from network device implementors as to how
they should expect that the OpenConfig interfaces and VLAN models should
interact with one another - especially in the context of the different types of
network element that they manufacture. This document seeks to provide some
clarification of the motivations for the OpenConfig structure, as well as
insight into the types of network element that the model seeks to cover.

## Use Cases and Motivating Principles
There exist three different network element types which typically exist in
today's networks:

*   **"Flat L2 switches"**- these devices typically have a single 4K VLAN
    space, provide only Ethernet switching capabilities, and no IP routing. They
    typically have limited ability to manipulate VLANs. They may support QinQ - and
    in this case may have the ability to switch on outer-tag, or the (outer,inner)
    tuple. As well as 'traditional' switches, this group of devices may include
    network elements such as OLTs which provide Ethernet-only switching for
    subscriber traffic.
*   **"PE routers"** - these devices typically act as IP/MPLS provider edge
    devices - where ports or interfaces can be terminated Layer 2 bridging
    domains (which may be local-only, or connected to other bridging domains through
    some form of backbone encapsulation - such as MPLS). In these devices, there is
    essentially the concept of a per-service VLAN space - and more complex VLAN
    operations may be performed (push, pop, swap etc.).
*   **"Hybrid switch router devices"** - these are network elements that combine
    both the ability to have switched VLANs within a global VLAN space, with the
    ability to terminate VLANs into a certain L2 or L3 forwarding table.
    Essentially, these devices tend to operate as a hybrid between the "PE router"
    device type and "Flat L2 switch" types defined here - with some
    implementation-specific complexities.

The OpenConfig model seeks to support all these types, with the following
particular considerations:

*   The management of a device which acts as a 'flat L2 switch' should continue
    to be operationally similar - that is to say, support a model where VLAN
    tags can be explicitly configured in a single namespace, and interfaces can be
    configured to interact with those VLANs - either as an 'access' port where a
    single VLAN exists, or a 'trunk' port where multiple VLANs should be carried
    over an interface.
*   Management of 'routed' devices should not involve interaction with the
    'switched' types of VLANs - that is to say, where VLAN encapsulation for a
    platform is specifically scoped to an individual interface, then this should not
    require any global configuration to be created.
*   Devices with multiple VLAN spaces, and per-instance VLAN spaces should be
    supported.
*   The OpenConfig model should not be overly prescriptive of the VLAN
    capabilities of an individual platform - particularly to ensure cases where
    platforms may differ in their ability to switch packets (e.g., on the inner VLAN
    when QinQ encapsulation is not lost).

## Relationship to the Network Instance Model

Network instance is the OpenConfig model that provides the ability to run
multiple forwarding or routing tables on a single network element. Instances can
be defined to be Layer 2 only, Layer 3 only or a combination of both. A special
type of network instance is defined (type DEFAULT), which is defined as the
'global' routing instance of the network device.

Currently, there is not a defined structure to the set of models, but it is
proposed that the VLAN model (currently /vlans) be rooted under an individual
network instance. This leads to a YANG tree similar to the one below.

```
               +--rw device* [hostname]
			     ...
                  +--rw ocif:interfaces
                  |  +--rw ocif:interface* [name]
			 	     ...
                  +--rw netinst:network-instances
                     +--rw netinst:network-instance [name]
                        +--rw netinst:interfaces
                        |  +--rw netinst:interface* [id]
				           ...
                        +--rw vlan:vlans
                           +--rw vlan:vlan* [vlan-id]
					           ...
```

In this case, a device has a global list of interfaces - corresponding to the
physical ports that exist on the device. This list is outside of the
network-instance model, since subinterfaces of these interfaces may correspond
to different network instances (e.g., a VLAN interconnect to an access network,
where multiple customer services exist on an individual interface).

An interface is then associated with a network-instance by virtue of the
reference type under 'netinst:interfaces'. Additionally, each network-instance
maintains its own list of VLANs - which are locally significant to that network
instance.

## Use Case: Flat Switch, VLAN-aware L2VPN, or Virtual Switch

If one pictures a flat Layer 2 switch with the following
*   An access interface -- where untagged frames should map to a 'red' VLAN.
*   A trunk interface -- which carries two VLANs - green and orange.

The diagram below shows how this is represented using the OpenConfig model.

This would be represented in the following data instance (see lines beginning
with # for annotations):

                "name": "DEFAULT"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this case, the configuration is similar to that which would be expected of a
basic L2 switch today. Since it is embedded in a network instance, there can
also be a multiplicity of such configurations - which allows L2 switches that
support multiple 'virtual switches' to simply duplicate network instances to
support each virtual switch, and L2VPN services which are VLAN-aware to utilise
the same approach if all ports are trunk-mode.

## Use Case: 'PE' device with routed subinterfaces and L2VPN

One of the major differences between PE devices and the flat L2 switch case that
is described above is the association of an individual interface with multiple
forwarding contexts - for example, one can imagine a device whereby:

*   One interface carries:
    *   A VLAN terminating into the global table, with IP configuration.
    *   A VLAN terminating into a Layer 2 switched virtual instance carrying
        multiple VLANs.
    *   A VLAN terminating into a PWE service.
*   A second interface carrying a single VLAN which terminates into the L2 PWE
    service.
*   A third interface carrying:
    *   A VLAN terminating into a L2VPN service carrying a single VLAN.
    *   A VLAN terminating into a L3VPN.

The representation of this mapping is shown in the diagram below.

It is notable that in this case, no use of the access-vlan or trunk-vlan leaves
is made. Essentially, it is possible to ignore these 'switched-vlan' leaves in
the case that an explicit network instance is required to forward traffic
between ports. This is typical of service provider PE edge devices.

If there is no case in which a device needs to match multiple VLANs that cannot
be specified with a single vlan encapsulation statement, then there is
essentially no need to support access-vlan and trunk-vlan on these platforms.
The operator does not lose any functionality. The vlan leaf is relatively
flexible, for example:

*   x.y can be used to match outer tag x, inner tag y.
*   x.* can be used to match all inner tags of outer tag x.
*   x..y.z can be used to match inner tag z with outer tags ranging from x to y.
*   x..y.a..b can be used to match out tags x to y with inner tags in the range a to b.
*   *.y can be used to match inner tag y with any outer tag.

Some of these options are obviously more flexible than particular hardware may
be able to implement, in this case, it is envisaged that the implementation
returns a NACK/NOK message to the client - rather than provide a deviation from
the model.

## Use case: Switch/Router Hybrid

In the case of a switch/router hybrid device ("brouter"? "swrouter"? "routitch?"
:-)) it is possible to have switched VLANs on an interface, which then has
accompanying subinterfaces that are routed into a particular network instance.

A device which has a trunk port switching VLAN IDs 1024-1030 within the global
network instance, and also routes VLAN 100 on the same interface into a private
L3 forwarding instance uses the following configuration:

```

Since there remain a class of devices which fall within this category of
configuration, supporting them within the model is seen to be a useful
endeavour. If a device corresponds to only one of these configuration models (it
is either just a switch, or a 'router'/'PE' device) then this hybrid
configuration is unlikely to be required.
